### Day 1: 04/06/202

**Today's Progress:** Set up the development tools and the "Coming soon..." page.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited about the fact that I'm finally starting to develop my personal website. I decided to go back to basics only using HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript; although I included the Bootstrap framework in version $.5.0. I already had the draft of what the page should look like when it's finished. Hopefully, I don't modify it later.
