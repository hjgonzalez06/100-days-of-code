## Log

### Day 1: 04/06/202

**Today's Progress:** Set up the development tools and the "Coming soon..." page.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited about the fact that I'm finally starting to develop my personal website. I decided to go back to basics only using HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript; although I included the Bootstrap framework in version 4.5.0. I already had the draft of what the page should look like when it's finished. Hopefully, I don't modify it later.

### Day 2: 05/06/202

**Today's Progress:**  Create a "Develop" branch, remove Bootstrap framework & start to add a Grid View from scratch.

**Thoughts:** I decided to remove Bootstrap framework because "basic is basic". Instead, I'm adding a Grid View from scratch; something I've never done before but I'm excited to do to improve my tech skills in CSS3. Hope it works the way I'm thinking it will.
