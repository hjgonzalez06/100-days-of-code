## Log

### Day 1: 04/06/2020

**Today's Progress:** Set up the development tools and the "Coming soon..." page.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited about the fact that I'm finally starting to develop my personal website. I decided to go back to basics only using HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript; although I included the Bootstrap framework in version 4.5.0. I already had the draft of what the page should look like when it's finished. Hopefully, I don't modify it later.

### Day 2: 05/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Create a "Develop" branch, remove Bootstrap framework and start to add a Grid View from scratch.

**Thoughts:** I decided to remove Bootstrap framework because "basic is basic". Instead, I'm adding a Grid View from scratch; something I've never done before but I'm excited to do to improve my tech skills in CSS3. Hope it works the way I'm thinking it will.

### Day 3: 06/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Finish to add the Grid View, write Media Queries breakpoints and create the website's Header.

**Thoughts:** I was doing my personal website's header. The Flexbox display is giving me a bit of a problem, but I'm working it out. I have to say that my raw CSS3 skills are a little rusty. But, luckily, I'm sure with this challenge I'll be reviewing it. Also, I wrote the Media Queries breakpoints for Responsive Design, but I'll work with it at last.

### Day 4: 07/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Fix a problem with Header elements display & add the website's Footer.

**Thoughts:** Well, I solved the problem with Flexbox display on Header, although it ended up being something else (as it usually happens). Also, I added the website's footer. Don't know why, but I like to do it before having the main content of the website up. What can I tell you, me and my stuff.

### Day 5: 08/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Start to add the Welcome section & delete useless files/folders.

**Thoughts:** I started to adding the Welcome section of my website. The  background of this section is giving me a bit of a problem, but I think to know the reason why it's happening and I'm working it out. In addition, I deleted the files and folders that I won't use in the website anymore.

### Day 6: 09/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Finish to add the Welcome section.

**Thoughts:** Today, I managed to solve the problem I had by placing a video as the background of the welcome section of my page. I also added the welcome text and styled it. Tomorrow I will be starting with the personal information section. Now, I feel more confident.

### Day 7: 11/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Start the layout of the About section.

**Thoughts:** Today, I went back to this challenge after a one-day break due to work issues. I started the layout of the About section of my personal website. One important thing I haven't done yet is to write the information I'm going to put in it. So far, so good. Just a little busy preparing the classes I'll be teaching.
