## Log

### Day 1: 04/06/2020

**Today's Progress:** Set up the development tools and the "Coming soon..." page.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited about the fact that I'm finally starting to develop my personal website. I decided to go back to basics only using HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript; although I included the Bootstrap framework in version 4.5.0. I already had the draft of what the page should look like when it's finished. Hopefully, I don't modify it later.

### Day 2: 05/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Create a "Develop" branch, remove Bootstrap framework and start to add a Grid View from scratch.

**Thoughts:** I decided to remove Bootstrap framework because "basic is basic". Instead, I'm adding a Grid View from scratch; something I've never done before but I'm excited to do to improve my tech skills in CSS3. Hope it works the way I'm thinking it will.

### Day 3: 06/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Finish to add the Grid View, write Media Queries breakpoints and create the website's Header.

**Thoughts:** I was doing my personal website's header. The Flexbox display is giving me a bit of a problem, but I'm working it out. I have to say that my raw CSS3 skills are a little rusty. But, luckily, I'm sure with this challenge I'll be reviewing it. Also, I wrote the Media Queries breakpoints for Responsive Design, but I'll work with it at last.

### Day 4: 07/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Fix a problem with Header elements display & add the website's Footer.

**Thoughts:** Well, I solved the problem with Flexbox display on Header, although it ended up being something else (as it usually happens). Also, I added the website's footer. Don't know why, but I like to do it before having the main content of the website up. What can I tell you, me and my stuff.

### Day 5: 08/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Start to add the Welcome section & delete useless files/folders.

**Thoughts:** I started to adding the Welcome section of my website. The  background of this section is giving me a bit of a problem, but I think to know the reason why it's happening and I'm working it out. In addition, I deleted the files and folders that I won't use in the website anymore.

### Day 6: 09/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Finish to add the Welcome section.

**Thoughts:** Today, I managed to solve the problem I had by placing a video as the background of the welcome section of my page. I also added the welcome text and styled it. Tomorrow I will be starting with the personal information section. Now, I feel more confident.

### Day 7: 11/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Start the layout of the About section.

**Thoughts:** Today, I went back to this challenge after a one-day break due to work issues. I started the layout of the About section of my personal website. One important thing I haven't done yet is to write the information I'm going to put in it. So far, so good. Just a little busy preparing the classes I'll be teaching.

### Day 8: 12/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**  Keep working on the About section, add the Download CV option & start to layout the Services section.

**Thoughts:** I'm still working on the design of the About section. I had some ideas about how I wanted to display the information in that section, but now I feel I'm not very sure about it. Nevertheless, I know I'll solve it soon; this creative blockage is only temporary. On the other hand, I added the Download CV option (just need to place the file) and started to work on the Services section layout.

### Day 9: 13/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Re-evaluate design and information display of the website & make minor changes to the code.

**Thoughts:** I'm still working on the layout of my website. I know I've said the same in my last 2 days, but I've been re-evaluating certain aspects about the design & the information that'll be displayed on the website. Finally, I think I'm coming out of creative blockage.

### Day 10: 14/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Finish to layout the About section of the website.

**Thoughts:** Finally, I finished the layout of the About section of my personal website. However, I still have to finish writing some of the information that I am going to put in that section; but now I feel more confident about how it'll be displayed. Also, I need to look for a few images that are related and represent my soft skills.

### Day 11: 16/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Finish to layout the Services section of the website.

**Thoughts:** I came back, after taking a little break to catch up on the classes I teach. Well, I finished to layout the Services section, but I still need to replace de "Lorem Ipsum" text with proper information for the section (same for almost the whole website). I think I'll save it for last. Also, I need to look for more icons & images that are appropriate to what I want to reflect. In addition, I need to look for a way to implement contact forms on a static website.

### Day 12: 17/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Work on the layout of the Work Process section of the website.

**Thoughts:** I made the layout of the Work Process section of my personal website. But just when I finished it, I came up with a better design for it and I will be changing it tomorrow. Furthermore, I did some research about contact forms on static websites, I just need to evaluate them and deciding on one. Nevertheless, I will look into it further.

### Day 13: 18/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Change the layout of the Work Process section of the website.

**Thoughts:** As I said I would do, today I changed the design of the Work Process section of my personal website. I feel more comfortable now with the layout of the information in that section. Also, I applied a bit of responsiveness in advance, although I will be focusing on that at the end.

### Day 14: 19/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Start to add the Contact section of the website.

**Thoughts:** I started adding the Contact section of my personal website. For now,  I've only done the contact form, for which I ended up using Formspree because it's a static website. I have to admit that I need to configure it a bit more; for example, implementing AJAX to avoid the visitor to be sent to another page. Also, I need to add an highlighting the reasons why the visitor could contact me and moving the links to my social networks from footer to this section.

### Day 15: 20/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Finish to add the Contact section of the website.

**Thoughts:** I finished doing the Contact section of my personal website today. I've even been adding new information to others section. To finish with the layout of the website, I only need to add the Projects section and a separator that I want to put in somewhere. And then it's my turn to apply JS and responsiveness.

### Day 16: 21/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Work on the Projects section of the website.

**Thoughts:** I started to develop the Projects section of my personal website today. I've managed to layout almost everything. I'm just stuck on getting a two-elements overlay effect to work. I think I'll have to do some research about it.

### Day 17: 22/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Finish to add the Projects section of the website & add the sections' links to the Navbar.

**Thoughts:** Today, I managed to getting two-elements overlay effect to work. In the end, it was a single line of code I needed to do it. Also, I added the links to navigate my personal website to the navbar. So finally, I finished the whole layout and it feels awesome. Now it's the turn to apply JS where needed.

### Day 18: 23/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Refreshing knowledges about CSS3/JS animations and effects.

**Thoughts:** I've been working on the animations and effects with CSS3 and JS. More than writing and adding code for my website, I'm first refreshing my knowledge by doing little practices. And so far, I don't think I've done that badly. Anyway, I'm seriously thinking about using the libraries that already exist. This is the reason why there are no commits in the repository of my personal website today.

### Day 19: 24/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Add filter funcionality to the About section & apply the animations to the website.

**Thoughts:** I added the animations to the website with AOS library. I think they look great and I like them quiet a bit. Also, I typed some #js code that allow to filter, in a certain way, the information shown in About section, so it seems that this information is replaced by another one when certain links located in the About section are clicked.

### Day 20: 26/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Apply AJAX to submit data from the contact form of the website.

**Thoughts:** I have made the AJAX code to handle the data submitting from the contact form of my personal website. I used jQuery with Promises, because the truth is that since I discovered the last ones I love them. I wanted to implement Axios library, but in the end I didn't include it. Now I want to make some changes in the behavior of the Navbar and then continue with the responsiveness.

### Day 21: 27/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Add the Hide on Scroll effect to the navbar & work on the Meta tags of the website.

**Thoughts:** Today, I worked a little on the Meta tags of my personal website. I still have to set up the Meta tags for appearance when I post the link on social networks. In addition, I applied the Hide on Scroll effect to the navigation bar and also slightly changed its style. I think I don't need to do anything with JS anymore, so now it's time to apply the responsive design.

### Day 22: 28/06/2020

**Today's Progress:**   Modify the Hide on Scroll effect, implement 2 validations to AJAX code & add the PDF to the Download CV button.

**Thoughts:** Actually, I didn't do much on my personal website today. I made some small modifications in the Hide on Scroll effect, then I implemented 2 security validations in the AJAX code execution and finally I added the PDF document with my CV, so it can be downloaded from the website. Oh, and I also added some alerts that use the SweetAlerts2 library. That was all.
